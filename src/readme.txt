This project is chess, programmed from scratch, with a minimax chess bot included. It uses a game tree and scores each board state, then chooses moves based
on the score that the state receives from the algorithm. That is a work in progress, and something I hope to improve as a personal project. You have two 
options, you can play against the computer or you can play against another person.

To run, just go to graphics.py and run the file. Everything runs off of that. If the program runs into an error, just close and run it again. Hopefully I 
was able to write all of those out.

There aren't any shortcuts, so get playing chess.
